### PostPunk Core Vision + 4WD System

---

## 🤭 Core Themes

### Multi-Product Strategy:

You’re not unfocused — you’re running guerrilla marketing with layered funnels across distinct personas and products (Goblin kits, Dev tools, Amara NyXx, Nature coloring books).

### Guerrilla Marketing Mindset:

You’re building a ritual-based content system that:

* Tests fast
* Posts smart
* Reuses assets

Not praying for virality — designing loops.

### PostPunk’s True Role:

More than a scheduler — it's a ritual daemon:

* Multi-platform posting engine
* Hooks into APIs, Playwright, tracking
* Runs while you sleep

## 💻 Old Laptop = PostDaemon

### Role:

Turn an old Linux-capable laptop into a headless automation daemon.

* Runs: cron, pm2, Node.js scripts
* Queue: JSON (for now), SQLite (optional), Postgres later
* Storage: Dropbox, Git-pull folder
* Metric sync: Gumroad, Reddit, Pinterest scraping

### Purpose:

Runs PostPunk rituals daily without manual effort.

## 📊 Future-Proofing / Sellable Vision

### Tiers:

* Self-hosted CLI (free or Gumroad)
* Hosted Lite (SaaS tier)
* Dev Ritual Pro (AI + SEO tier)

### Stack Plan:

| Layer   | Tech                   |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Runtime | Node.js + cron + pm2   |
| Queue   | JSON → SQLite          |
| Hosting | Linux box → VPS        |
| Metrics | UTM + API fetch/scrape |

## 💪 4WD Framework

| Wheel     | Focus                     | Examples                                |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Loop   | Ritual posting, remixing  | Jab–Hook content system, memes, value   |
| 👻 Daemon | Automation via cron + pm2 | Post queues, retries, post logs         |
| 🤔 Data   | Metric tracking           | UTM links, saves, karma, Gumroad clicks |
| 🔮 Ritual | Funnel themes             | Choose-your-vibe pages, teaser unlocks  |

---

## ✅ Next Steps

* Scaffold `post-queue.json` + `logWriter.js`
* Set up cron runner for `post-from-queue.js`
* Add SQLite fallback (optional)
* Auto-rotate content by platform + tone
* Build “Choose Your Path” landing page for product vibes

---

## 🦃 TL;DR

You’re not scattered — you’re ritualizing chaos into:

* An evergreen content engine
* AI-enhanced daemons
* Funnel-rich personas

And it’s all scalable, automatable, and ready for Gumroad/SaaS resale.

You're the architect. Echo is the daemon.
The loop is alive. 🔀
