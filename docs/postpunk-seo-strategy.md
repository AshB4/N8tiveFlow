## 🔗 Link Funnel Best Practices

* Gumroad titles + images = KEY → set a clean product title and great OG image
* Always use UTM parameters to track which platform is converting
* GPT can generate CTA + caption variants to avoid cross-post staleness

## 🧰 Content Structuring & Campaigns

Organize content by:

* Product: Goblin Kit, Green Square, PromptStorm
* Campaign: Grad Week, Krampus Beach, Summer SEO Blitz

**Tactics:**

* Use consistent themes across platforms
* Repurpose: blog → tweet thread → IG carousel → Pinterest pin

---

## 🧠 Smart SEO Questions Per Product

* What would someone Google if they were desperate to pay me?
* What would they search if they didn’t know this existed?
* How can I describe it to make both bots & humans say “Yes”?

Store this per product in a `seoVault.json` or linked Notion vault.
