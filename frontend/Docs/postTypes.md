# 🧾 Post Types (Styles & Functions)
PostPunk supports all types of content, from chaos memes to launch announcements.  
Here’s a breakdown of supported types and how they’re used in automation and logs.

---

## 🎯 Why Post Types Matter
They help you:
- Apply different rules per type (e.g., memes recycle more)
- Track success by format in UTM charts
- Customize formatting per platform (e.g., no hashtags on LinkedIn)

Use the `type` field in post metadata.
```json
{
  "title": "We launched!",
  "type": "launch",
  "platforms": ["linkedin", "pinterest"]
}
```
